# Kotlin-Friend-List
This app is a simple test of using Kotlin and XML features to create a functional front end for future applications. This front end is reused to some extent in the following 2 applications when more useful backends are added. As it sits, this application does nothing other than load up the UI on your device and allow you to scroll through it similar to a webpage, with some links to dynamically generated activities.

## Running 
- Open Android Studio and import the project once you have it cloned. 
- Either look at the code or pack it into an apk or run it on an AVD
